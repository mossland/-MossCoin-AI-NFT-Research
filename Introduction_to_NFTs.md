# Introduction to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

## What are NFTs?

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that use blockchain technology. Each NFT represents something unique and differentiates itself from other tokens in terms of value and properties.

### Key Features of NFTs

- **Uniqueness**: Each NFT has unique attributes recorded on the blockchain.
- **Proof of Ownership**: NFTs signify ownership of various types of digital assets, such as digital art, music, and in-game items.
- **Immutability**: Leveraging blockchain technology ensures that the record of each NFT is permanent and unchangeable.

## NFT Standards

NFTs primarily follow certain standards used on the Ethereum blockchain.

### ERC-721

- **Individuality**: The [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/ko/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721) standard allows each token to be unique and have different attributes.
- **Ownership**: This standard ensures that each NFT represents a specific owner.

### ERC-1155

- **Multi-Token Standard**: [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155) allows a single contract to represent multiple tokens at once.
- **Efficiency**: This standard is more efficient in terms of transaction and storage than ERC-721.

## Derivable NFTs

### What are Derivable NFTs?

Derivable NFTs are an emerging concept in the NFT space. They are NFTs that have the ability to evolve or generate new assets based on certain conditions or interactions.

#### Characteristics of Derivable NFTs

- **Evolving Attributes**: Unlike traditional NFTs, which are static, derivable NFTs can change their properties or appearance over time or in response to specific triggers.
- **Interactivity**: These NFTs can interact with other NFTs, smart contracts, or external data sources to create new assets or transform themselves.
- **Dynamic Nature**: Derivable NFTs are not just static tokens but dynamic assets that can offer a range of possibilities and experiences for users.

#### Use Cases for Derivable NFTs

1. **Gaming**: In the gaming industry, derivable NFTs can represent characters or items that evolve based on the player's actions or achievements.
2. **Art and Collectibles**: Artists can create NFTs that change over time, reacting to external events or evolving as part of a narrative.
3. **Real Estate and Virtual Worlds**: In virtual worlds or metaverse platforms, derivable NFTs can represent properties or assets that change according to community interactions or other factors.

#### Potential of Derivable NFTs

- **Increased Engagement**: The dynamic nature of these NFTs can lead to higher levels of user engagement and interaction.
- **New Forms of Digital Ownership**: They allow for more complex forms of digital ownership and asset management.
- **Innovation in Digital Art and Gaming**: Derivable NFTs open new horizons for creativity and innovation in various fields.

### Conclusion

Derivable NFTs bring a fascinating and dynamic aspect to the world of digital assets. They hold the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and perceive value in the digital realm.
